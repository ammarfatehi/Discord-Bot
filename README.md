# Spotify-Discord-Bot
A discord bot that allows the user to play music from YouTube and Spotify. Also has other commands to automate parts of handling a Discord Server.

# Setup:
Make sure you have pip installed youtube-dl, discord.py, and spotipy.
You will need your own discord developers token for your bot and a spotify token. Make sure to paste those in the right spots in the code. 
Currently the default playlist for the spotify command is my playlist, if you would like be sure to change the default username to your own.
Once the bot has been successfully added to your server use the .Help command to learn how to use all the commands of the bot.
